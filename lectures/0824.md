# More on Sessions

Remember: don't use the repl mini-browser to test session code!

It doesn't seem to handle Flask sessions properly.

Use a regular browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.)

# Using GitHub OAuth to allow logins

We'll use this library: [https://github-flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://github-flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Example repl: [https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-0824-try-login#main.py](https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-0824-try-login#main.py)

First, don't put "github" or "oauth" into the name of your app, or else Google Chrome might think you are doing "phishing".

Second: any time you see `pip install foo`, such as `pip install GitHub-Flask`:

What that's saying is: you need to download and install an extra python package.

But for repl, we use this instead:

In the Shell window, use:

```
python -m poetry add GitHub-Flask
python -m poetry install
```

Also: for the client id and client secret, use the Secrets function in Repl.it
