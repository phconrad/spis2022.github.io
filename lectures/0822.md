# Sessions

Web applications, by nature are "stateless".  

Each request and response is separate.

However, we can use some "tricks" to create what is called a "session".

According to [this link](https://testdriven.io/blog/flask-sessions/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20store%20data,server%2Dside%20where%20it's%20decoded.):

> In order to store data across multiple requests, Flask utilizes cryptographically-signed cookies (stored on the web browser) to store the data for a session. This cookie is sent with each request to the Flask app on the server-side where it's decoded.
>
> Since session data is stored in cookies that are cryptographically-signed (not encrypted!), sessions should NOT be used for storing any sensitive information. You should never include passwords or personal information in session data.

Here's an example of a Flask web app that uses a session:
