# Lab 0 

I'll start by going over what you need to know to work on lab 0.

We number our labs from zero instead of one, because many things in Computer Science number from zero.  

* Note: There's a reason for "numbering from zero"; if you like, we can go into that later; feel free to ask at the end if you are curious.  

Lab 0 covers some "housekeeping issues": we'll be getting you signed up for some of the tools you'll need throughout SPIS.

We might also get into a little bit of Python.  We may not have time to get into it too much; but we'll have plenty of time later to go into it more deeply.

Lab0 covers:
* Adding yourself to the GitHub organization: [github.com/spis2022](https://github.com/spis2022)
* Signing up for [repl.it](https://repl.it), an online platform for programming

# Adding yourself to the GitHub organization

Here are the instructions.  Let's just take a few minutes and do it now:

[Joining spis2022 GitHub org](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zCwD6AKWNcvPCOZ0JVn9ThhKgZ-57O4RRrIxWOQpbg/edit#heading=h.n3u7umx0bwbn)

# Signing up for repl.it

Now let's sign up for repl.it, using these instructions (and as shown in the animation):

1. Navigate to [repl.it](https://repl.it)
2. Don't fill in the form; instead Click the *Continue with Google* button
3. Sign in with your UCSD email 
4. Skip over the intro stuff (as shown in the animation)
