## Enabling Audio in a repl

To enable audio:

* On the  â‹® menu next to *Files*, click *Show hidden files* 
* add `audio = true` as first line in the `.replit` file

```
audio = true
```

## Some resources for sound/audio

Python-based (that do not depend on repl.it)
* [Playing sound with basic python](https://pythonbasics.org/python-play-sound/)
  * This may not work in repl.it

Repl.it (Python-based)
* [Enabling Audio in your repl](https://docs.replit.com/misc/playing-audio-replit)
* [Audio on repl.it [BETA] documentation](https://replitgithubio-1--ritza.repl.co/repls/audio)

Repl.it (non-Python)
* [Making music with replit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kTXQ_EnYek)
  * Javascript based, but little to no Javascript knowledge needed  


## More Plain Python

* [A repo with some good code in it](https://github.com/ayushmankumar7/MAKE-MUSIC-WITH-NUMPY---YOUTUBE/blob/master/ADSR.ipynb)
  * Youtube video that goes with it, however, a lot of it is not in English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgp7C5TTsCs
