# Testing

Using pytest with repl.it: step-by-step, with animation

* Put functions in a separate file, `functions.py`
* In `main.py`, use `from functions import my_func` for each function
* Create separate file `tests.py` with `import pytest` at the top
* To run the main program, just use the `Run` button like usual
* To run the tests, use `pytest tests.py` in the `Shell` window

Important to know:
* **The first time you click `Run`, it may take some time for `pytest` to be installed**
* If you try to type `pytest tests.py` too soon, you'll get an error
* This is shown in the animation
* In that case, just wait (in the main `Console` window, for `pytest` to be installed)

Here's a repl that you can "fork" to play with this code for yourself:

# While loops

Here is an example of rewriting the first_factor_found function using a while loop instead of a for loop

Some notes on while loops:
* In general, the form is `while condition:` on the first line, where `condition` is something that's true or false.
* The first time the while loop is encountered, if the condition is false, we skip over it entirely.
* Otherwise, if the condition is true, we go through all of the code once, and then come back and start over, evaluating the condition again
* Ideally, something in the code will change the condition to eventually be false; **otherwise, we will have an infinite loop**, which is almost never what we want.

```python
while condition:
   do_something()
   do_something_else()
```

A more specific example:

```python

i=1;
while i<10:
  print("i=",i)
  i+=1
  
```

Here's the output:

```
i= 1
i= 2
i= 3
i= 4
i= 5
i= 6
i= 7
i= 8
i= 9
```
