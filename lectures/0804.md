Using pytest with repl.it: step-by-step, with animation

* Put functions in a separate file, `functions.py`
* In `main.py`, use `from functions import my_func` for each function
* Create separate file `tests.py` with `import pytest` at the top
* To run the main program, just use the `Run` button like usual
* To run the tests, use `pytest tests.py` in the `Shell` window

Important to know:
* **The first time you click `Run`, it may take some time for `pytest` to be installed**
* If you try to type `pytest tests.py` too soon, you'll get an error
* This is shown in the animation
* In that case, just wait (in the main `Console` window, for `pytest` to be installed)
