## Foundations of Programming

Identifiers, variables, data and functions

Learning outcomes/key ideas
* Describe (and change) the type of data in Python
* Store data in variables using assignment statements
* Describe the difference between printing and returning values
* Define and call functions in Python


# No official textbook, but some handy references:

In case you want to dig deeper into any of these topics:

* W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
* A textbook co-authored by Niema: https://stepik.org/course/56730/promo
* A book that also includes some material on Picobot: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CSforAll/

Later on, after we've had a chance to learn some more Python, this resource (suggested by Mentor Nola) is also helpful for 
checking your understanding.  It doesn't explain things&mdash;rather it just gives you practice problems:

# What is an identifier?

- The name of something.
- For example, the name of a variable:
  ```python
  my_number = 123
  ```
- Later, we'll learn of _other things_ that we can give names: functions, classes, modules; the same naming rules apply.
- Composed of letters, numbers and/or underscores starting with a letter or underscore.
- Case matters: ABC is different than abc

It's important to choose names thoughtfully:
* A well-chosen name can make a problem easier to solve
* A poorly-chosen name can make a problem harder to solve

We'll see examples of this as we go through our coding practice together.

# What is a keyword?

A word in the language that has a defined meaning.


Keywords may not be used as identifiers

```python

course = "CSE 8A"   # ok!
class = "CSE 8B"    # not ok; "class" is a keyword

```

# Case matters:

By case, we mean uppercase vs. lowercase, i.e. capital letters vs. small letters.

```python
if = 3    # not OK; if is a keyword in Python
IF = 4    # allowed, but weird; we typically don't use all upper case for python variables
iF = 5    # allowed, but also a bit weird
If  = 6   # allowed, but weird.
```

# What is a statement

What is a statement?

A statement is one unit of code.  It is often one line of code:
  
Examples of one line statements in Python:
  
```python
import math             # one statement; imports the functions from the math module
print("Hello, World!")  # one statement; a function call to print
my_number = 123         # one statement; assigns the value 123 to the variable my_number
print("square root of ", my_number, "is", math.sqrt(my_number)   # one statement; a function call to print
```
 
You can separate multiple statements on a single line using semicolons.  This is uncommon among Python programmers, but you will see it sometimes

```python
x = 3; y=4; z=5   # Three assignment statements
```

Sometimes a statement might span multiple lines.

```python
print("x=",x,
      "y=",y,
      "z=",z)
```
