# No official textbook, but some handy references:

In case you want to dig deeper into any of these topics:

* W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
* A textbook co-authored by Niema: https://stepik.org/course/56730/promo
* A book that also includes some material on Picobot: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CSforAll/

Later on, after we've had a chance to learn some more Python, this resource (suggested by Mentor Nola) is also helpful for 
checking your understanding.  It doesn't explain things&mdash;rather it just gives you practice problems:
