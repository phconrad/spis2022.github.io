* 10:15-11:30: Breadth / Depth: You may choose either:

Today's breadth lecture is by Niema, and discussses [Bioinformatics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c9ifVpexhycfEROZDKP4T-NK0nbj0f11FsKsr81yiug/edit#slide=id.p)

Today's depth lecture is by Phill, and will provide a review and more practice on the Python skills and concepts we've already learned.
