# SPIS 2022, FOCS, 08/05 (08:45-10AM)

# Announcements

Overview of today's calendar:

* 08:45-10AM: FOCS (this session)
* 10:15-11:30: Breadth / Depth: You may choose either:
  - Breadth: a lecture on a new topic (one that is interesting, but not essential to the rest of the SPIS program)
  - Depth: reviewing the material already covered to get a deeper understanding

Today's breadth lecture is by Niema, and discussses [Bioinformatics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c9ifVpexhycfEROZDKP4T-NK0nbj0f11FsKsr81yiug/edit#slide=id.p)

Today's depth lecture is by Phill, and will provide a review and more practice on the Python skills and concepts we've already learned.

# What is Iteration

Iteration is just a fancy computer science word for 'repeated steps'

or "looping"

We "iterate" over something by repeating the same steps on it multiple times.

Each time we go through the process, that's one "iteration"

We use this work iteration in connection with loops.

# Iterating over strings and lists

We can use a for loop to iterate over many kinds of collections in Python.

We've already seen iterating over a list:

[Repl](https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-FOCS-0805#main.py)

```python
colleges = ["Revelle", "ERC", "Marshall", "Sixth", "Warren", "Muir"]

for college in colleges: 
  print(college)
```

Output:

```
Revelle
ERC
Marshall
Sixth
Warren
Muir
```

We can also iterate over the letters of a string:

[Repl](https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-FOCS-0805-1#main.py)

```
campus = "UC San Diego"

for letter in campus:
  print(letter)
```

Output:

```
U
C
 
S
a
n
 
D
i
e
g
o
```

If we want to do this with a number, i.e. iterate over all of the digits of a number, we can convert it to a string:

```python
number = 8675309

number_as_string = str(number)

for c in number_as_string:
  print(c)
```

Output:

```
8
6
7
5
3
0
9
```

# Another example

```python
number_as_string = str(number)
for c in number_as_string:
     print(c)
```

Result:

```
8
6
7
5
3
0
9
```

The code above treats each `c` as a character.  But we can convert those back to numbers like this:

```
for c in number_as_string:
     new_number=int(c)
     print(new_number + 1)
```

Output:

```
9
7
8
6
4
1
10 
```


# Data types

```python

# list of integers
enrollments = [4766, 4683, 4451, 4665, 4702, 4860]

# list of mixed data types
mixed_list = ["UC San Diego", 3.14, True, ["Tritons","Sun God"], 28127 ]

# string (collection of characters)
campus = "UC San Diego"

# iterating over list of ints
for e in enrollments:
  print(e)
  
```

We can take the `len` (length) of lists and strings, but not int or float:

# A few basic algorithms

There a few basic algorithms that are helpful to know

One of them is called the "accumulator pattern", and it's how you add things up.

Suppose you have a list of numbers.  From [this document](https://ir.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enrollment/ugcoll.pdf) I got the enrollments by college from 2016.  (If someone can find more up to date data, let me know)

Here's that data as a table:

| College | Enrollment |
|---------|------------|
| Revelle | 4766       |
| John Muir | 4683     |
| Thurgood Marshall | 4451 |
| Earl Warren | 4665 |
| Eleanor Roosevelt | 4702 | 
| Sixth | 4860 |

We can make a list of these numbers:

```python
enrollments = [4766, 4683, 4451, 4665, 4702, 4860]
```

We then might want to add all of those up.  According to the document, the total should be 28,127.

Full disclosure: there's an easy way [repl](https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-FOCS-0805-3#main.py)

```python

enrollments = [4766, 4683, 4451, 4665, 4702, 4860]
total = sum(enrollments)
print(total)
```

Output:
```
28127
```

However, we want to show another way.    Why?
* The technique we are going to show illustrates how the built-in Python function `sum` works under the hood.
* There are times when you don't have the `sum` function handy (some programming languages don't have it)
* The accumulator pattern can be used for more than just forming a sum



# Accumulator pattern for a sum

[Repl](https://replit.com/@phtcon/spis2022-FOCS-0805-4#main.py)

```
enrollments = [4766, 4683, 4451, 4665, 4702, 4860]

total = 0 # accumulator variable
for e in enrollments:
  total = total + e  # add up each enrollment
  print("this enrollment:", e, "total so far: ", total)

print("total enrollment = ", total)
```

# Dictionary

In Python, a dictionary is a collection "key/value" pairs, inside curly braces, like this:

```python
# Data from: https://blink.ucsd.edu/instructors/courses/enrollment/week3.html

ucsd_college_dictionary = {
  "Marshall": 5335,
  "Muir": 5181,
  "Revelle": 5431,
  "Roosevelt": 5220,
  "Sixth": 5235,
  "Warren": 5355,
  "Seventh": 1586
}


```

* The things on the left of the colon (`:`), i.e. "Marshall", "Muir", etc. are called keys
* The things on the right of the colon (`:`), i.e. 5335, 5181, etc. are called values

We can get a collection of the keys by using `.keys()`

We can get a collection of the values by using `.values()`

You don't have to end the name with dictionary.  A better practice is to name it something
that makes it clear what is being "mapped to what".

For example, if we are "mapping college name to enrollment", we might call the dictionary:

<img width="907" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/183123798-e15a4d77-5d88-40ab-b6b3-c872cec4012d.png">

# List vs Tuples

```python
# tuple
colleges = ("Marshall", "Muir", "Revelle", "Roosevelt", "Sixth", "Warren",
            "Seventh")

# list
schools = ["UCSD", "UCSB", "UC Irvine"]


# Tuples and lists have many things in common
# for loops work the same
```

Examples of things that are the same:

<img width="807" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/183127280-cb191627-df48-4aaa-b00d-011570d80c33.png">


Lists are mutable.  
* That means that can be changed (mutated)
* I can use append, for example

<img width="509" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/183127385-77deba87-de13-422d-9e38-9e13b507e3d6.png">

But tuples are "immutable".  We cannot change them after they are defined.

We use tuples for things that we should not change once the program has started, that we want to define once and keep the same:

<img width="661" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/183127533-10c7acba-6fe1-47a1-9896-27ba1892bd89.png">

Why do we even *have* tuples if they are less capable than lists?

It's a matter of keeping things tidy, and working for efficiency:
* If something should not be changed after it is defined, it removes a class of bugs if we make it so we cannot even accidentally change it.
* In some cases, tuples might be more efficient than lists; internally, some computations might go faster (we are unlikely to notice a difference with anything we are doing in SPIS, but it explains why both exist.)
# tuples are immutable
