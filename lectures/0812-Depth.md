# Q: How do you remember all the things?

Python has so many keywords, structures, syntax, symbols... how do you keep it all in your head?

A: 1st answer: practice, practice, practice

A: 2nd answer: Honestly, some parts you do and some parts you dont.

For example: In Python, I have for, while, if/else, function defintion, list syntax in my head.

BUT: when it comes to things like:
* How do you add something to a list
* How do you search for something in a list
* etc.

I know that Python has a way to do it.  So does: Java, JavaScript, Ruby, C++ (in the STL), etc.

But I don't necessarily remember the specifics!  I often have to look it up, every single time.

So, that's ok!

# A bit about references

Let's talk about Pointer Assignment vs. Deep Copy
