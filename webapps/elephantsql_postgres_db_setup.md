Use your GitHub or Google account to login.

When setting up your account, you'll see a screen like this.  For team name, I suggest you use your UCSD login name.

Here are the suggested choices for the other fields:

If you then click on the name of the database, you'll see a page like this one.  Note that next to the URL there is an eye; if you click it, you'll see the full URL which you can copy/paste.  You'll need this for your code.
